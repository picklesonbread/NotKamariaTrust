NotKamariaTrust – Privacy Policy

Last Updated: 19.11.2025

This Privacy Policy explains what data NotKamariaTrust (“the Bot”) collects, why it collects it, and how that data is used.

1. Data the Bot Collects

NotKamariaTrust only collects the minimum data required to operate its commands. This may include:

Temporarily Processed Data

(never stored long-term)

Message content (only when commands are triggered)

Usernames, IDs, and role info

Channel or server metadata required for command execution

Message history (only when a command specifically requires it)

This data is processed in real time and is not saved to any external database.

2. Long-Term Stored Data

NotKamariaTrust does NOT permanently store:

Messages

Personal information

Server logs

IP addresses

DMs

Biometric or sensitive info

If future features require saving data (leaderboards, settings, etc.), it will be opt-in and added to this policy.

3. Why Data Is Collected

Data is only processed to:

Execute slash commands

Manage roles when triggered by a command

Allow features like quizzes, roasts, utilities, etc.

Moderate or respond to messages

Improve bot functionality and performance

The Bot never sells or shares user data.

4. Third-Party Sharing

The Bot does not share data with any third parties.
The only external platform involved is Discord, which processes data according to its own policies.

5. Data Removal

Since NotKamariaTrust does not store personal user data, there is nothing to delete.

If you want the bot removed from your server, simply:

Kick the bot

Remove its OAuth authorization

Delete any roles created by the bot (optional)

6. Children’s Privacy

The Bot does not knowingly collect information from children younger than 13.
Discord already restricts accounts under 13 from using the platform.

7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may update over time. Continued use of the Bot means you accept the updated policy.
