im also thinking about additional command for recipes ive done because i share pictures sometimes of what i baked in the server and sometimes people ask for the recipes so im thinking of adding a /recipes command where it would show categories which would be names of each infividual pastry and when u choose one the bot will send ingredients and the recipe for it and would it be possible to include pictures my pictures? 
so there would be options: (do them in alphabetical order)

- cinnamon rolls

Ingredients
► milk [180 ml / 3/4 cup]
► sugar [50 g / 1/4 cup for the dough + 70 g / 1/3 cup for the filling (brown sugar recommended for the filling)]
► butter [50 g / 1/4 cup for the dough + 50 g / 1/4 cup for the filling]
► yeast [7 g dry or 15 g fresh]
► egg [1 piece]
► flour [360 g]

Additionally:
► salt [1/2 teaspoon]
► cinnamon [2 teaspoons]

For the frosting (optional):
► cream cheese (e.g. Almette type) [25 g / 1 heaping tablespoon]
► heavy cream [20 g / 2 tablespoons]
► powdered sugar [50 g / 1/2 cup]

Preparation
Place the milk, 50 g of butter, and 50 g of sugar in a saucepan. Heat over low heat until the sugar and butter completely dissolve.

Pour the warm mixture into a large bowl and check the temperature with your finger. If the milk is warm but not hot(!), add the yeast. Stir and set aside for 10–15 minutes.

Once the starter has risen, add the egg and mix. Gradually add the flour and a pinch of salt while mixing with a dough hook attachment. Mix until the dough is smooth and uniform. The dough should be sticky and even slightly runny — this is completely normal. Cover with a cloth and leave to rise for about 1 hour.
*At this point, take the butter out of the fridge if you keep it there — you’ll need room-temperature butter for the filling later :)

Transfer the risen dough onto a work surface and quickly knead into a smooth ball. Lightly dust with flour (no more than 1–2 tablespoons). Roll out the dough into a rectangle (it doesn’t have to be perfect, but the more even it is, the neater your rolls will be). My rectangle was about 30 x 40 cm.

In a small bowl, cream together 50 g of butter with the sugar and cinnamon. Spread the mixture evenly over the dough. Alternatively, you can brush the dough with butter first and then sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture over it, but the first method is easier, less messy, and keeps the filling more moist and aromatic — so that’s the one I recommend :)

Roll up the dough tightly along the shorter side to form a compact log. Cut the roll into slices about 3 cm thick and place them flat in a baking pan lined with parchment paper. I recommend using a deep baking dish and arranging the rolls so that after the second rise, they touch each other (as shown in the photos). This helps them stay soft and moist while baking.
*NOTE: At this stage, you can freeze the rolls or refrigerate them overnight if you plan to bake them the next day.

Let the prepared rolls rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 180°C and prepare the frosting by mixing together the cream cheese, heavy cream, and powdered sugar.

Bake at 180°C for 17–19 minutes (depending on your oven) until golden brown. After removing from the oven, glaze while still warm — this helps keep them fresh for longer.

- cheese star

Ingredients:

Yeast dough
-500 g wheat flour
-14 g instant yeast (2 packets) or 50 g fresh yeast
-50 g sugar
-200 ml milk
-2 eggs
-50 g butter

Filling
-300 g curd cheese (quark)
-1 egg
-1 packet vanilla sugar
-50 g sugar
-40 g butter
-optional – 50 g candied orange peel

Also
-1 egg for brushing the dough
-powdered sugar for dusting or glaze: 1/2 cup powdered sugar + 2 tablespoons orange or lemon juice + optional 1 tablespoon candied orange peel

Preparation

Yeast dough
If using fresh yeast, prepare a starter: mix the yeast with a tablespoon of sugar until dissolved, then add 100 ml of warm milk and a tablespoon of flour. Mix well and set aside for 10 minutes to rise. Instant yeast can simply be mixed with the flour.

Place the flour in a bowl, add the yeast, the remaining milk, and sugar, and gently mix. Add the eggs and mix slowly again.

Add the softened butter and begin kneading the dough. Knead for about 15 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Cover and let rise for about 45 minutes.

Filling
Place the curd cheese (quark) in a bowl, add the egg, vanilla sugar, sugar, and diced butter. Mix for about 1 minute. Optionally, stir in the candied orange peel.

Shaping the dough
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead briefly. Form a ball and divide it into 4 equal parts.

Roll out the first piece into a circle about 25 cm in diameter. Place it on a large baking tray lined with parchment paper. Spread 1/3 of the cheese filling over it, leaving about a 1 cm border around the edge.

Roll out the second piece of dough and place it on top of the first layer. Spread with another third of the filling, then place the third layer of dough on top. Spread with the remaining cheese and cover with the final circle of dough.

Cut the dough into 16 sections, but do not cut all the way through to the center (leave the middle uncut), as shown in the photos below.

Twist each section twice, alternating directions — twist one piece twice to the right, and the adjacent one twice to the left. Pinch the ends of each pair together. Let the shaped dough rise for about 20 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Brush the top of the dough with a beaten egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of milk. Place in the preheated oven.

Bake for about 25 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven, let cool slightly, and then dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with glaze (powdered sugar mixed with juice).

- apple and caramel rolls

Ingredients
(makes about 24 pieces)

Dough

250 ml milk

1 packet instant yeast (7 g)*

500 g wheat flour

50 g sugar

a pinch of salt

1 egg

2 egg yolks

70 g soft butter

for brushing: 1 egg

Filling

250 g dulce de leche (caramelized milk spread) from a can

3 apples (e.g. reinette variety)

Cinnamon topping

2 tablespoons butter

7 tablespoons sugar

2 teaspoons cinnamon

Glaze

4 tablespoons lemon juice

about 1/2 cup powdered sugar

Preparation
Warm the milk slightly (it should be just lukewarm — around 37–40°C), add the instant yeast, stir, and set aside for 5 minutes. Remove the eggs and butter from the fridge to bring them to room temperature.

Sift the flour into a bowl, add the sugar and salt. Mix, make a well in the center, pour in the milk with yeast, and stir with a spoon. Then begin kneading the dough, adding the egg and yolks. After about 5 minutes of kneading, add the butter and continue kneading (by hand, with a stand mixer dough hook, or in a bread machine) for about 10–15 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1½ hours.

Meanwhile, prepare the apples: peel and dice them. Also prepare the cinnamon topping — place all ingredients in a bowl and rub together with your fingers until crumbly.

Turn the risen dough out onto a floured surface and knead briefly to remove air bubbles. Divide it into two parts and roll each into a rectangle about 25 x 30 cm. Gently spread with dulce de leche and sprinkle with apples.

Roll up the dough tightly along the long edge to form a log, and cut each roll crosswise into 12 slices. Arrange the pieces in two 20 x 30 cm baking pans lined with parchment paper, leaving small gaps between them (or use one very large rectangular pan). Set aside to rise for about 45 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 180°C. Brush the tops of the rolls with beaten egg and sprinkle with the cinnamon crumble. Bake for about 20 minutes, until golden brown. If using two pans, bake one after the other.

After baking, drizzle with glaze: warm the lemon juice, add powdered sugar, and stir until smooth.

Notes
Alternatively, you can use 30 g of fresh yeast. To make a starter: mix the yeast with 1 teaspoon of sugar, then add 1 tablespoon of flour and 50 ml of milk, stir, and let rise for 10 minutes. Add this mixture to the flour along with the remaining milk and continue as directed in the recipe

- chałka

Ingredients for the Challah (Sweet Braided Bread)

500 g wheat flour (type 450 — cake flour) – half a standard 1 kg bag

1 cup lukewarm milk – 250 ml

80 g real butter – slightly less than half a stick

7–8 g dry yeast or 30 g fresh yeast

5 level tablespoons sugar – up to 60 g

a pinch of salt

Ingredients for the Crumb Topping (Streusel)

50 g wheat flour

30 g real butter

30 g sugar

Challah Recipe

Sift 500 g of wheat flour into a large bowl (half of a standard 1 kg package). Add up to 60 g of regular or fine sugar (about 5 level tablespoons), a pinch of salt, and 7–8 g of dry yeast. Mix the dry ingredients together.

Add 1 cup (250 ml) of lukewarm whole milk and a bit less than half a stick of melted and cooled butter (about 80 g).
Mix everything with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula. Then knead the dough using a mixer fitted with dough hooks for at least 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. You can also knead it by hand.

Tip:
If using fresh yeast, you’ll need 30 g (a bit more than ¼ of a 100 g cube). Prepare a starter first:
Take 100 ml of milk (about 2/5 cup – warm, not hot), 2 tablespoons of flour, 30 g fresh yeast, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Mix everything well, cover with a cloth or plastic wrap, and set in a warm place for 20 minutes. The mixture should rise and become very foamy. Add this starter to the rest of the ingredients and knead until smooth.

Leave the kneaded dough in the same bowl or transfer it to a larger one to allow room to rise. Cover with a cloth or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for at least 1½ to 2 hours, until the dough triples in volume.

From this amount of dough, you can bake one large challah or, as I did, divide the dough in half and bake two medium-sized challahs.
Turn the dough out onto a work surface and knead briefly. My dough weighed about 920 g, so I divided it into two balls of about 460 g each.

Cover one ball with a cloth or plastic wrap so it doesn’t dry out. Divide the second ball into four equal pieces (about 115 g each). Roll each piece into a rope about 40 cm long (for a thicker, shorter loaf, make the ropes shorter and fatter). Place the four ropes on a sheet of parchment paper and pinch the ends together. Braid the challah as shown in the instructions or photos.

For the second ball, I divided it into three parts and rolled three ropes, braiding a traditional three-strand challah. You can decide whether you want to braid with three or four strands.

Place the challahs on a single large baking tray lined with parchment paper, leaving plenty of space between them. Cover with a cotton cloth and let rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes, until nicely puffed up. Brush the tops with milk or with a beaten egg mixed with milk (if you can eat eggs).

Sprinkle the risen challahs generously with the prepared crumb topping (streusel). You can make it ahead while the dough is rising — simply mix all the ingredients together and rub them with your fingers until crumbly.

Place the tray with the challahs on the middle rack of an oven preheated to 175°C (top/bottom heat). Bake for about 25 minutes, until golden brown and risen.

Once baked, remove immediately from the oven. The challahs should be soft, fluffy, and beautifully browned on top.

-Strawberries and Cream Cake 🍓

Ingredients for a 26 cm (10 inch) cake, about 9 cm high (without decoration):
1 cup = 250 ml

Sponge cake:

6 eggs (size M), at room temperature

¾ cup wheat flour (about 120 g)

¾ cup cornstarch or potato starch (about 120 g)

1 cup sugar (about 200 g)

2 tablespoons water

Strawberry cream filling:

500 g strawberries

500 g sweet whipping cream (30–36%), chilled

80 g sugar

4 level teaspoons powdered gelatin

Additionally:

about 340 g strawberry jam (approx. 8 heaping tablespoons)

400 g sweet whipping cream (30–36%), chilled

1 tablespoon powdered sugar

whipped cream stabilizer (śmietan-fix, optional)

Preparation:

Line the bottom of a 26 cm (10-inch) springform pan with parchment paper, then fasten the ring. Set aside.

Prepare the sponge cake:
Mix the flour with the starch in a bowl, then sift the mixture through a sieve. Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat. Then, while still mixing, add the egg yolks one at a time. Gently fold in the flour–starch mixture in portions using a spatula or wooden spoon, just until combined. Add the water while mixing.

Transfer the finished batter into the prepared springform pan and bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (top and bottom heat) for about 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. After baking, invert the cake (still in the pan) onto a cooling rack or counter lined with parchment paper. (This helps create an even, flat top.) Let it cool completely, then remove it from the pan and cut horizontally twice to create three layers.

Prepare the strawberry cream:
Wash, dry, and hull the strawberries. Place them in a bowl, add the sugar, and blend into a purée.

In a small bowl, sprinkle the gelatin over 4 tablespoons of cold water and let it sit for 5–10 minutes to bloom. Once swollen, heat gently while stirring until fully dissolved. Remove from heat and, while whisking constantly, gradually mix in the strawberry purée. Place the mixture in the fridge until it begins to thicken slightly (check often so it doesn’t set too much — this may take 30 to 90 minutes).

Whip the chilled cream until stiff peaks form, then gently fold it into the lightly thickened strawberry mixture.

Place the first cake layer on a serving platter. Fasten a tall cake ring around it (you can stack two shorter rings if needed). Spread 4 tablespoons of strawberry jam over the layer, then spread ⅓ of the strawberry cream on top. Cover with the second sponge layer, spread another 4 tablespoons of jam, then half of the remaining cream, and top with the third layer. Spread the rest of the cream on top.

Refrigerate the cake, preferably overnight, to let the cream set.

Whip the remaining cream with optional whipped cream stabilizer (śmietan-fix) until stiff. Toward the end, add the powdered sugar. Transfer the whipped cream to a piping bag and decorate the top and sides of the cake. Garnish with pieces of fresh strawberries.

Store the cake in the refrigerator for up to 3–4 days.

-cheesecake with blueberries

170 g tea biscuits

70–80 g melted, cooled butter

Cheesecake filling:

350 g white chocolate

200 ml heavy cream (36%)

200 g ready-to-use cheesecake cheese (preferably thick)

500 g mascarpone cheese

1 packet (12 g) of real vanilla sugar or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 packet of whipped cream stabilizer (Śmietan-fix)

200 g washed and well-drained blueberries (you can pat them dry on a paper towel)

Topping:

300 ml chilled heavy cream (30% or 36%)

1 tablespoon powdered sugar

1 teaspoon whipped cream stabilizer (Śmietan-fix)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

About 80–100 g washed and well-drained blueberries for garnish (you can pat them dry on a paper towel)

Crust:

Place the biscuits in a blender and blend into crumbs.

Transfer to a bowl, add melted butter, and mix until combined.

Pour the mixture into a 21 cm springform pan lined with parchment paper. Press down evenly and smooth the surface. Set aside.

Cheesecake filling:

Pour the cream into a saucepan and bring it to a boil.

Break the chocolate into pieces and place it in a bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and stir until melted. Cover the chocolate mixture with plastic wrap (touching the surface) and let it cool completely.

Blend the blueberries into a purée.

In a large bowl, combine mascarpone, cheesecake cheese, and vanilla sugar. Mix with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the whipped cream stabilizer and mix again.

Gradually (in 2–3 portions) add the cooled chocolate mixture to the cheese mixture. After each addition, briefly mix on medium speed until combined.

Spread 1/3 of the cheesecake mixture over the crust in the pan and smooth it out. Place in the freezer for about 8–10 minutes.

Divide the remaining cheesecake mixture into two equal parts. Add 2 tablespoons of blueberry purée to one part and the rest of the purée to the other. Mix both well.

Spread the lighter blueberry layer over the chilled cake and smooth it. Freeze again for about 10 minutes.

Spread the darker blueberry layer on top and smooth it out. Refrigerate the cheesecake overnight.

Topping:

Carefully remove the chilled cheesecake from the pan. Run a knife around the edges to loosen it, then transfer the cheesecake to a serving plate.

Pour the chilled cream into a bowl, add powdered sugar, whipped cream stabilizer, and vanilla extract, and whip until stiff.

Spread the whipped cream over the top of the cheesecake, smooth it slightly, and use a spoon to create small swirls or indentations. Decorate with blueberries.
